    "reason-one": "Thanks to rapid AI advancements, creating an app has never been easier. Yet popular ASO tools (App Radar, AppTweak, Sensor Tower, etc.) remain prohibitively expensive and unnecessarily complex for indie developers and small teams. What's truly needed is a platform that autonomously handles everything—from multilingual keyword selection to ASO content generation—streamlining not just keywords, but the entire release process.",
    "reason-two": "App Store Connect also introduced friction into the release workflow. That's why I took an AI-first approach and built AppAgent from the ground up, reimagining how ASO and app releases should work together in one seamless, efficient platform.",
