# White Label Configuration Guide

This document explains how to configure the AppAgent application for white labeling.

## Overview

The white label configuration system allows you to customize the application's branding, including:

- App name and tagline
- Domain name
- Email addresses (support, info, marketing)
- Marketing contact name
- Social media handles

## Configuration

All white label settings are configured through environment variables. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and customize the following values:

### White Label Environment Variables

```bash
# App branding
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=AppAgent
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=app-agent.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_TAGLINE=From ASO to Release, All Streamlined
NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCRIPTION=AppAgent automates ASO while simplifying every step from planning to release. Effortlessly generate multilingual release notes, track growth, and handle updatesâ€”all in one place. OSS alternative to AppTweak, App Radar, and Sensor Tower.

# Contact information
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@app-agent.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFO_EMAIL=info@app-agent.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_EMAIL=shu@app-agent.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_NAME=Shu from AppAgent

# Social media
NEXT_PUBLIC_TWITTER_HANDLE=@ngo275
```

## What Gets Customized

The white label configuration affects:

1. **App Metadata**: Page titles, descriptions, Open Graph data
2. **Email Templates**: Sender names and addresses in all email communications
3. **Layout Components**: App name in headers and footers
4. **Legal Documents**: Privacy policy, terms of service references
5. **Localization**: App name and tagline in multiple languages
6. **Authentication**: Cookie domain settings
7. **Stripe Integration**: App name in payment processing

## Localization Support

The localization files (`locales/en.json` and `locales/ja.json`) use template variables like `{{appName}}` and `{{tagline}}` that are automatically replaced with your configured values at runtime.

## Testing Your Configuration

1. Update your `.env` file with your custom values
2. Restart the development server: `yarn dev`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your changes
4. Check email templates by triggering email flows
5. Verify legal documents at `/privacy`, `/terms`, etc.

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production, ensure all environment variables are properly set in your hosting environment (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

## Technical Implementation

The configuration is centralized in `src/lib/config.ts` and exported as `WHITE_LABEL_CONFIG`. This object is imported throughout the application to replace hardcoded values.

A utility function `interpolateWhiteLabelValues()` in `src/lib/white-label-utils.ts` handles template variable replacement in localization strings.
